**1\.   Question 1**

What can we infer about our kNN model when the value of K is too big?

*   The training accuracy will be high, while the out-of-sample accuracy will be low.
*   The model will capture a lot of noise as a result of overfitting.
*   **The model is overly generalized and underfitted to the data.** 
*   The model will be too complex and not interpretable.

**2\.  Question 2**

When splitting data into branches for a decision tree, what kind of feature is favored and chosen first?

*   The feature that increases entropy in the tree nodes.
*   The feature with the greatest number of categories.
*   The feature that splits the data equally into groups.
*   **The feature that increases purity in the tree nodes.**

**3\.  Question 3**

What is the relationship between entropy and information gain?

*   High entropy and low information gain is desired. 
*   **When information gain increases, entropy decreases.**
*   High entropy and high information gain is desired.
*   When information gain decreases, entropy decreases.

**4\. Question 4**

Predicting whether a customer responds to a particular advertising campaign or not is an example of what?

*   **Classification problem**
*   Machine learning
*   Regression
*   None of the above

**5\.  Question 5**

For a new observation, how do we predict its response value (categorical) using a KNN model with k=5?

*   Take the average among 5 points whose features are closest to the new observation.
*   **Take the majority vote among 5 points who are the most similar to each other.**
*   Take majority vote among 5 points whose features are closest to the new observation.
*   Form 5 clusters and assign the new observation to the most similar cluster, taking the mean value as prediction.
