### Question 1 : 

### Supervised learning deals with unlabeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with labelled data.

**1 / 1 point**

*   True
*   **False**

**Correct**

Correct! Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, and supervised learning deals with labelled data

### Question 2

**The "Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for:**

**1 / 1 point**

*   Prediction of class/category of a case; for example, a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not.
*   **Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics.**
*   Finding items/events that often co-occur; for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer.

**Correct**

Correct! Regression techniques are used for continuous variable prediction, whereas classification techniques handle dependent variables with discrete classes.

### Question 3 

**When comparing Supervised with Unsupervised learning, is this sentence True or False?**

**In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate.**

**1 / 1 point**

*   True
*   **False**

**Correct**

Correct! Unsupervised learning has fewer models and evaluation methods than Supervised learning.
